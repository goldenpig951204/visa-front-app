                  <div>Cookies, Pixels, and Similar Tracking Technologies Used: We and our authorized partners also collect information via cookies, web beacons, pixels, tags, embedded scripts, session replay tools, SDKs, Local Storage such as HTML5 and Local Shared Objects (“LSOs,” also known as Flash cookies), or other data retrieval and tracking technologies (“Tracking Technologies”), such as your Internet Service Provider and IP address, device identifier, browser type, operating system, your device’s WiFi MAC address or Bluetooth MAC address, the date and time you access our Digital Properties, the pages you accessed while visiting our Digital Properties, and the Internet address from which you accessed our Digital Properties. Cookies are a type of technology that installs a small amount of information on a user’s computer or other device when they visit a website. Cookies permit a website to, for example, recognize future visits using that computer or device. Some cookies exist only during a single session and some are persistent over multiple sessions over time. We and our partners use these Tracking Technologies to ensure basic functionality of our Digital Properties; to remember user preferences (including your preferences regarding Tracking Technologies); maximize the performance of our Digital Properties and Services; provide you with offers that may be of interest to you; measure the effectiveness of our Digital Properties, marketing campaigns, and email communications; and to personalize online content. These Tracking Technologies may be used to track you over time and across devices, websites, and Services.Additionally, we may employ, either directly or through third parties, tracking pixels. Tracking pixels are tiny, transparent graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to provide analytical information concerning the user experience as well as to support custom marketing activities for users of our Digital Properties. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, tracking pixels are embedded invisibly on web pages. Our Digital Properties may use tracking pixels to help us better manage content, such as by improving the user interface or improving our marketing programs or the marketing of our affiliates, business partners, and other third parties (including for interest-based advertising as described below). The Digital Properties may use information to create aggregate tracking information reports regarding user demographics, traffic patterns and purchases. We may also link tracking information with personal data.Third-Party Companies: To provide you with a more relevant and interesting experience, we may work with third party companies to display ads or customize the content on our Digital Properties or through other communication channels. These companies may use Tracking Technologies as described in this Notice to gather information about you, which may include your precise location, your visits to the Digital Properties, and your visits elsewhere on the Internet. These companies also may use this information to provide you with more relevant advertising known as interest-based advertising, which may include sending you an ad on another online service after you have left our Digital Properties (i.e., retargeting).Your Choices: You may choose whether to receive some interest-based advertising. If located in the European Economic Area, Switzerland or the United Kingdom, then essential cookies must always be used in order to provide the Services you have requested, However, you will be provided notice of our use of and subsequent processing of data collected through non-essential cookies (i.e. functional cookies, analytics cookies, targeting cookies and social media cookies) at the time when you first visit the IrVisa website. If located in the European Economic Area, you may also more generally opt in to the use of cookies<a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/"></a>. The Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) and Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) also provide mechanisms for you to opt out of interest-based advertising performed by participating members at <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a> and <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/">optout.networkadvertising.org</a>. You can also visit <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices">http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices</a> for information on the DAA’s opt-out program specifically for mobile apps (including use of precise location for third party ads). Opting out of interest-based advertising will not opt you out of all advertising, but rather only interest-based advertising from us or our agents or representatives. Further, cookie-based opt-outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. For example, if you have opted out on your computer browser, that opt-out will not necessarily be effective on your mobile device.

We are not responsible for the effectiveness of these or any other third-parties’ opt-out options or programs.Do Not Track: Some browsers have incorporated Do Not Track (“DNT”) preferences. Most of these features, when turned on, send signals to the website you are visiting that you do not wish to have information about your online searching and browsing activities collected and used. As there is not yet a common agreement about how to interpret DNT signals, we do not honor DNT signals from website browsers at this time. However, you may refuse or delete cookies. If you refuse or delete cookies, some of our website functionality may be impaired or some of the advertising served to you may not be relevant for you anymore.
